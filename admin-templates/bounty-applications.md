# Round (#) - GMC Call for Bounty Applications - Deadline is (MONTH) (DAY)

This thread is for applications for Rocket Pool’s (MONTH) (DAY), (YEAR) - (MONTH) (DAY), (YEAR) bounties. Please only post bounty applications in this thread. If you would like to discuss and/or ask questions about any applications you see in this thread, we ask that you do so in this [separate forum thread (link)](LINK) which has been established for all community discussions related to this round of applications. Only those grant applications that are posted in this thread and timestamped by (MONTH) (DAY), (YEAR) at 23:59 (11:59 PM) UTC will be considered. Any bounties posted after that deadline will be carried over to the next award period.

This is the expected schedule for round (#):

* Application Period ((MONTH) (DAY) - (MONTH) (DAY))
* Application Discussion Meetings - one for each subcommittee ((MONTH) (DAY) - (MONTH) (DAY))
* Negotiation Period ((MONTH) (DAY) - (MONTH) (DAY))
* Scoring Deadline ((MONTH) (DAY))
* Final Voting Amendments, Discussion and Finalization ((MONTH) (DAY) - (MONTH) (DAY))
* Award Announcement ((MONTH) (DAY))

<details><summary>Differences Between Grants and Bounties</summary> 
Grants are intended to be applied for by those who are wishing to carry out the work themselves. Bounties are open-ended goals that could be met by anyone, including those other than the proposing party. In other words, if I believed that Rocket Pool needed a fifty-foot paper mache orange rocket for publicity purposes and I wanted to be the one to built it, I would apply for a grant. If I instead thought Rocket Pool needed a fifty-foot paper mache orange rocket for publicity purposes but I wanted it to be open to whoever built it first to claim the reward (similar to a prize), then I’d apply for a bounty.

To guide you in your application, the GMC has established the following goals and the following scoring rubric:

<details><summary>GMC Goals</summary>

Grants, bounties, and retrospective awards should make it easier and/or more attractive to do one or more of the following:

- become a node operator

- operate a node, mint rETH

- hold or use rETH

- improve the quality of life for the protocol and its community.
</details>

<details><summary>Bounties Rubric</summary>

When evaluating grant applications, the GMC takes into account the following goals:

- If the bounty is completed successfully, to what extent does it further the GMC goals?

- To what extent is it likely that the bounty can be feasibly claimed/completed successfully?

- If the bounty is successfully completed, how large is the benefit to the protocol relative to the size of the proposed costs?

# Bounty Proposal Template

## Guidelines

* The goals of the Bounty Proposal are:
  * to communicate your bounty idea clearly, in general terms, such that the GMC can decide if it's worth pursuing.
  * to estimate the benefits and costs attached to your proposal.
  * to disclose any relevant conflicts of interest.
* Answers to the template questions do not need to be highly detailed. Estimates or ranges are acceptable. Brief answers are also fine.

# Bounty Definition Template

## Guidelines

* When a single proposal bounty proposal has parts that must be completed by different groups, it should become multiple definitions.
* Where reasonably possible, bountiy definitions should limit the number of distinct skillsets required for completion of the bounty.
* Bounties should be defined in terms of the smallest worthwhile unit of work. IE: $25 to add/update a single relevant FAQ question rather than $5,000 to update the FAQ.
* Include any information or resources that might reasonably help a bounty hunter complete the bounty.
* Think carefully about which tasks are required, and which can be optional.
* Clearly list any dependencies, if the bounty cannot be completed in all circumstances.
* Only include multiple milestones for large bounties with natural points of division.
