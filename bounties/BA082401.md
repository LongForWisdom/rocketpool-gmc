# Eigenlayer Integration

## Summary 
Enable Rocket Pool node operators to join the Eigenlayer network. This should be done while Rocket Pool retains senior debt, meaning Rocket Pool contracts are the withdrawal credentials from the beacon chain. The aim is for Rocket Pool node operators to participate in Eigenlayer activities and be slashed for misbehavior.

## Dependencies
Is there anything that must happen (outside of a bounty hunter's control) before it is possible to complete this bounty? This may be other bounties that must be completed first, an upcoming event or change or a regular occurrence that triggers a valid bounty. This section is optional. May be later removed from the definition if the dependency becomes permanently met. 

## Required Milestones

### Milestone A - Build Contract
**Payout:** $16,666
Build the outlined contract to allow Node Operators to register with Eigenlayer and function like regular validators in their network including slashing. This ought to be verified with a core RP team member, ideally Kane, as a plausible solution.

### Milestone B - Feedback and Integration
**Payout:** $16,666
Incorporate feedback from the audit and the Eigenlayer team. Then, in coordination with RP and Eigenlayer, release the integration for public use.

### Milestone C - Front-End and Documentation
**Payout:** $16,666
Create proper front end components as well as documentation to make the product easy to use and understand.

## Further Notes
Here is a breakdown of the expected product cycle:
###Design:###
*Point RP withdrawal address*
*Keeper network informs of minipool count changes*
*Keeper network informs of RP penalties*
*Ability to force exit - you want to be able to do that ASAP after RP penalties (you don’t have as much collateral) or Eigenlayer penalties (you don’t want RP penalties to supersede you)*
*You’ll remain vulnerable to simultaneous penalties forever*
*Their slasher and escrow stuff should work just fine for ETH; just pass the RPL through for ease, or consider using that as slashable too for efficiency*

###Work:###
*Stage 1: Build*
    *Smart contract to point the RP stuff at – mostly will be just like the solo one except for*
    *not giving full value to the validators*
    *pod already handles multiple validators, here it’s just packaged per node – might be a couple for loops to swap*
    *boot or revalue stuff based on keeper*
    *make keeper scripts in python or similar*
*Stage 2: Audit cycle*
     *complete an audit with feedback implementations with a reputable auditing firm discussed and coordinated with the GMC*
     *coordinate with the team at Rocket Pool and Eigenlayer for broad comments on the design and technicals*
*Stage 3: UX/ presentation*
    *Web page needs to handle the new thing you can add to a pod - for simplicity make it so a pod is either all solos or one RP node*
    *documentation needs to be written so that users can understand the steps of the process a la the Rocket Pool documentation*

## Verification
The product should be tested considerably by the applicant before being presented to the Rocket Pool core team, ideally Kane and a senior engineer from Eigenlayer. Further, a reputable 3rd party auditing firm should be engaged with the coordination of the GMC and the bounty applicant. The costs of this audit should be covered by the GMC.
