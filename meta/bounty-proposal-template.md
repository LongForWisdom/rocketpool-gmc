# Bounty Proposal Template

## Guidelines
* The goals of the Bounty Proposal are:
  * to communicate your bounty idea clearly, in general terms, such that the GMC can decide if it's worth pursuing.
  * to estimate the benefits and costs attached to your proposal.
  * to disclose any relevant conflicts of interest.
* Answers to the template questions do not need to be highly detailed. Estimates or ranges are acceptable. Brief answers are also fine.
