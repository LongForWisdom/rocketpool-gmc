# Bounty Definition Template

## Guidelines

### Avoiding Ambiguity
* Try to minimize ambiguity and uncertainty as much as possible.
* Use 'MUST' and 'SHOULD' statements for required milestones. 
  * 'MUST' denotes something without which no money will be paid out. 
  * 'SHOULD' denotes something that is expected to be completed, but the bounty may still be paid out if a good reason is provided by the bounty hunter for its lack.
* Use 'MAY' statements for optional milestones.
* Ensure all text is written for the bounty hunter as the audience. Remove or reword anything addressed to the GMC.
* In the event external parties are referenced, make it clear how the bounty hunter is to interact with them. For example, if person X is verifying the work, does the bounty hunter speak to X directly, or does this take place via the GMC.
* Do not include statements committing external parties to work if they have not agreed to do it. For example, you cannot commit the core team to review something unless they have agreed that they will review it.
* Do not introduce variables outside of a bounty hunter's control. For example, the pDAO should not need to sign off on a bounty payout. If the pDAO needs to sign off, it should sign off on the bounty definition before it is opened to bounty hunters.
* Clearly list any dependencies, if the bounty cannot be completed in all circumstances.

### Structure
* When a single proposal bounty proposal has parts that cannot be completed by the same bounty hunter, it should be split into multiple definitions. 
* Bounties should be defined in terms of the smallest worthwhile unit of work. For example, $25 to add/update a single relevant FAQ question rather than $5,000 to update the FAQ.
* Only include multiple milestones for large bounties with natural points of division.

### Other Notes
* Where reasonably possible, bounty definitions should limit the number of distinct skill sets required for completion of the bounty.
* Include any information or resources that might reasonably help a bounty hunter complete the bounty.

# Bounty Name 

## Data
* Repeatable?
* Expiring?
* Skillsets for completion? (See existing bounties and reuse where possible, new skillsets are recommended if sufficiently distinct)
* Relevant tags? (See existing bounties and reuse where possible, new tags are recommended if sufficiently distinct)
* Min reward (USD)?
* Max reward (USD)?
* Any linked definitions? (e.g. if a single bounty proposal becomes multiple definitions.)
* Any dependencies? 

## Summary 
Short 1-3 sentences describing the bounty.

## Dependencies
Is there anything that must happen (outside of a bounty hunter's control) before it is possible to complete this bounty? This may be other bounties that must be completed first, an upcoming event or change or a regular occurance that triggers a valid bounty. This section is optional. May be later removed from the definition if the dependency becomes permanently met. 

## Required Milestones
What _must_ be completed for a bounty hunter to claim some amount of bounty. Described per milestone.

### Milestone A - <Name of Milestone>
**Payout: ** <payout amount>
Clear bulleted list or subheadings covering the items that must be completed and/or adhered to for this milestone to be valid.

### Milestone B - <Name of Milestone>
**Payout: ** <payout amount>
Clear bulleted list or subheadings covering the items that must be completed and/or adhered to for this milestone to be valid.

### Milestone C - <Name of Milestone>...

## Optional Milestones
What tasks _may_ be completed for a bounty hunter to earn extra bounty rewards. Described per milestone. This section is optional.

Optional milestones may be less strictly defined than required milestones. You may aggregate multiple minor considerations that would contribute to a payout. 

### Milestone D - <Name of Milestone>
**Maximum Payout: ** <maximum payout amount>
Clear bulleted list of the items that would contribute to payout for this milestone.

### Milestone E - <Name of Milestone>...


## Further Notes
Anything you think that would be beneficial for a bounty hunter to know when working on this bounty. Maybe be divided into subsections as needed.

* SHOULD assist bounty hunters via feedback, direction and oversight upon request.

## Verification
Who is expected to verify that the work delivered meets the relevant milestones? This person or group must have agreed to do this in advance of this definition being published. This person or group should have any relevant skillsets needed to properly verify the bounty work.
